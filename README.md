# communication-hub-markis-hajk

A .NET Core 3.1 SignalR application handling communication between Markis and Hajk.

## Installation

- Build and publish the application with Visual Studio.
- Install the [.NET Core Hosting bundle](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1) on the hosting machine.
- Host the application however you like, we've used IIS for several years.

## Why a new communication hub?

This application replaces the communication hub built on the (end of life) .NET Core 2.2 platform. This application contains exactly the same functionality, but the UI has been slightly refreshed.
